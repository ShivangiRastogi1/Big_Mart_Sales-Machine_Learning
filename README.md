# Big_Mart_Sales-Machine_Learning
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

Problem:

Time of day : Higher sales in the mornings and late evenings
Time of year : Higher sales at end of the year
Store size and location
Items with more shelf space
